# ReadmeGenerator

<h2> Hello, this is my readme generator. I hope you enjoy it. </h2>

<h4> Here are the criteria for the assignment </h4>

<ul>

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
  
<li>WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions</li>
<li>WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README</li>
<li>WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests</li>
<li>WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under</li>
<li>WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile</li>
<li>WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions</li>
<li>WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README</li>

</ul>

<p> there's no deployed link but please enjoy the video I submitted, and if you can believe it, I did it in one take. Shocking, I know. </p>

Thank you for checking out my work :)


<h1> IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!</h1>
<h4> I somehow broke my original repository under this name, so I enlisted the help of one of my instructors to try to fix it.
In the end he suggested I just make a new one and copy everything over, so that's what I did.</h4>
